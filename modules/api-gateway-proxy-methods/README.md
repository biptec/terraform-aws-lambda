# API Gateway Lambda Function Proxy Methods Module

This module can be used in conjunction with [the api-gateway-proxy module](../api-gateway-proxy) to configure an API
Gateway REST API to route all requests from a root path to a lambda function.

Refer to [the module docs](../api-gateway-proxy/README.md) for the `api-gateway-proxy` module for more details on how to
use this module. Specifically, see the section [Can I expose additional lambda functions in a decentralized
manner?](../api-gateway-proxy/core-concepts.md#can-i-expose-additional-lambda-functions-in-a-decentralized-manner)
