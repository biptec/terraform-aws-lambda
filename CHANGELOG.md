## Description

<!-- A description of the changes made in this release. Be sure to update any TODOs. -->

- You can now configure a custom assume role policy for the IAM role in the `lambda` module using the new `assume_role_policy` input variable. This is useful in a few special cases when the default assume role policy won't work, such as using Lambda functions to rotate secrets in AWS Secrets Manager.

## Description

<!-- A description of the changes made in this release. Be sure to update any TODOs. -->

- The `lambda` module now allows you to mount an EFS file system in your Lambda functions using the new `mount_to_file_system`, `file_system_access_point_arn`, and `file_system_mount_path` variables. See [this example](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/package-lambda/tree/master/examples/lambda-vpc) for sample usage.

## Description

<!-- A description of the changes made in this release. Be sure to update any TODOs. -->

- **Terraform 0.13 upgrade**: We have verified that this repo is compatible with Terraform `0.13.x`! 
    - From this release onward, we will only be running tests with Terraform `0.13.x` against this repo, so we recommend updating to `0.13.x` soon! 
    - To give you more time to upgrade, for the time being, all modules will still support Terraform 0.12.26 and above, as that version has several features in it (`required_providers` with `source` URLs) that make it more forwards compatible with `0.13.x`. 
    - Once all Gruntwork repos have been upgrade to work with `0.13.x`, we will publish a migration guide with a version compatibility table and announce it all via the Gruntwork Newsletter.

<!-- RELEASE_NOTES_DRAFTER_MARKER_MODULES_AFFECTED_NEXT -->


## Description

<!-- A description of the changes made in this release. Be sure to update any TODOs. --> 

The `lambda` module is now more robust to partial failures in the module. Previously you could end up in a state where you couldn't `apply` or `destroy` the module if it only partially applied the resources due to output errors. This release addresses that by changing the output logic.

Note that previously this module output `null` for all the outputs when `create_resources` was `false`. However, with this release the output is converted to `""`. If you depended on behavior of `null` outputs, you will need to adjust your code to convert `null` checks to `""`.

## Description

<!-- A description of the changes made in this release. Be sure to update any TODOs. --> 

This consolidates the lambda resources in `modules/lambda` and `modules/lambda-edge`, taking advantage of the TF12 features that allow it. This allows for better maintainability of the modules.
<!-- RELEASE_NOTES_DRAFTER_MARKER_DESCRIPTIONS_NEXT -->


## Migration Guide

This renames the `aws_lambda_function` resources as a part of consolidating the two versions down to one. As such, you will need to move the resources in the state file in order to avoid downtime.

NOTE: If you are using `terragrunt`, the `state mv` calls should be done using `terragrunt` instead of `terraform`.

## Description

<!-- A description of the changes made in this release. Be sure to update any TODOs. --> 

**All the modules are now terraform 0.12.0 compatible**. Note that this means the modules are **no longer compatible with terraform 0.11 and under**. Starting this release, you must use terraform 0.12.0 or greater to use this module.

All the module variables have been updated to use concrete types based on the new type system introduced in terraform 0.12.0. You can learn more about the types in [the official documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/types.html).

Note that as part of this, we switched to using `null` to indicate unset values when passing them through to resources. If you were previously using a 0 value (`""` for strings and `0` for numbers), review the module `variables.tf` file to double check if the 0 value has been converted to a `null`.

# v0.5.1
_Released Feb 20, 2019_
### Modules affected

- `lambda`

### Description

- This release introduces support for [lambda layers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html) in the lambda functions created by the `lambda` module.

### Special thanks

# v0.5.0
_Released Dec 10, 2018_
### Modules affected

- `lambda` **[Breaking Change]** 
- `lambda_edge` **[Breaking Change]** 

### Description

- **Breaking Change**: the `lambda` and `lambda_edge` modules no longer export the zip file to the `source_dir`, but rather to the module path under the name `${var.name}-lambda.zip`. This is customizable using the `zip_output_path`. You can set this to variable to `${var.source_dir}/lambda.zip` to get the old behavior.
- This release fixes a bug where you could end up with a perpetual diff in the terraform plan, caused by zipping up the previous runs' archive file.

### Related links

<br>

# v0.4.0
_Released Dec 6, 2018_
### Modules affected

- `lambda` **[Breaking Change]** 

### Description

- **Breaking Change**: the `lambda` module removes the `wait_for` variable as it was not working as intended due to a limitation in terraform's use of `depends_on` with data sources. Additionally, the implementation of `wait_for` introduced a perpetual diff issue where the `plan` would always detect a change. The removal of `wait_for` fixes that.

### Migration guide

To upgrade to this version, remove the `wait_for` input parameter in all calls to the `lambda` module.

# v0.3.0
_Released Oct 15, 2018_
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/package-lambda/pull/22: 

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE

The `scheduled-lambda-job` module now namespaces all of its resources with the format `"${var.lambda_function_name}-scheduled"` instead of `"${var.lambda_function_name}-scheduled-lambda-job"`. This makes names shorter and less likely to exceed AWS name length limits. If you `apply` this new version, your CloudWatch events, targets, and permissions will be destroyed and recreated, which is typically harmless. If you wish to override the namespacing behavior, you now set a new input variable called `namespace`. 
<br>

# v0.2.3
_Released Sep 24, 2018_
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/package-lambda/pull/21: Add a new parameter called `wait_for` to the `lambda` module. All the resources in the module will not be created until `wait_for` is resolved, which allows you to execute other steps (e.g., create zip file) before this module runs. This is a workaround for the lack of `depends_on` for modules in Terraform. 
<br>

# v0.2.2
_Released May 27, 2018_
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/package-lambda/pull/13, https://github.com/gruntwork-io/package-lambda/pull/14: We've added a new `keep-warm` module that can be used to invoke your Lambda functions on a scheduled basis, and with a configurable concurrency level, keeping those functions warm to avoid the cold start overhead.
<br>

# v0.2.1
_Released Mar 1, 2018_
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/package-lambda/pull/11: Add new `lambda-edge` module that can be used to deploy Lambda@Edge functions with Terraform.

- `lambda-edge` [**BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE**]
<!-- RELEASE_NOTES_DRAFTER_MARKER_MODULES_AFFECTED_NEXT -->


## Description

<!-- A description of the changes made in this release. Be sure to update any TODOs. -->

- Fixed the CloudWatch log group name for `lambda@edge` to sync with what is created by `lambda@edge`. Previously the CloudWatch Log Group name was incorrect, causing `lambda@edge` to create a new, separate log group instead of the one configured for it in the module.

## Migration guide

The new name will conflict with the existing CloudWatch Log Group created by the lambda function. You can import the existing CloudWatch Log Group using `terragrunt import` (or `terraform` if you are using Terraform). The address to use depends on how you are calling the module. The easiest way to find the address is to run a `terragrunt plan` (or `terraform plan` if using Terraform) and look for the `aws_cloudwatch_log_group.log_aggregation` resource in the plan, and use the full address to the resource being created.

Alternatively, you can tear down the faulty CloudWatch Log Group managed in the module and keep the auto created one outside of terraform management by setting the `should_create_cloudwatch_log_group` input variable to `false`.

## Description

<!-- A description of the changes made in this release. Be sure to update any TODOs. -->


-  **Terraform 1.1 upgrade**: We have verified that this repo is compatible with Terraform `1.1.x`! 
    - From this release onward, we will only be running tests with Terraform `1.1.x` against this repo, so we recommend updating to `1.1.x` soon! 
    - We have also updated the minimum required version of Terraform to `1.0.0`. While our repos might continue to be compatible with pre-1.0.0 version of Terraform, we are no longer making any guarantees of that.
    - Once all Gruntwork repos have been upgraded to work with `1.1.x`, we will publish a migration guide with a version compatibility table and announce it all via the Gruntwork Newsletter.

-  This release also includes the following changes:
    - Rename `vars.tf` to more canonical `variables.tf`
    - Improve description for `use_managed_iam_policies` variable

## Description

<!-- A description of the changes made in this release. Be sure to update any TODOs. -->

- Updated to manage CloudWatch Log Group for the lambda function in Terraform. This enables you to configure various settings, like KMS encryption keys for encrypted log events, and retention periods. This change is **backward incompatible**: refer to the migration guide down below for more details.
<!-- RELEASE_NOTES_DRAFTER_MARKER_DESCRIPTIONS_NEXT -->


## Migration guide

Each of the modules that create lambda functions have been updated to manage the CloudWatch Log Group in Terraform. This means that terraform will attempt to create the Log Group when you update to this version, which will conflict with the existing Log Group that was created by Lambda when you first deployed the function.

To avoid this creation, you can set the `should_create_cloudwatch_log_group` input variable to `false`.

Alternatively, you can import the existing CloudWatch Log Group using `terragrunt import` (or `terraform` if you are using Terraform) to the new address. The address to use depends on how you are calling the module. The easiest way to find the address is to run a `terragrunt plan` (or `terraform plan` if using Terraform) and look for the `aws_cloudwatch_log_group.log_aggregation` resource in the plan, and use the full address to the resource being created.

## Description

<!-- A description of the changes made in this release. Be sure to update any TODOs. -->

- Updated to use managed IAM policies instead of inline policies for all IAM roles. Managed IAM policies are more friendly for compliance checkers and is generally recommended by AWS as best practice.

Note that this is **a backward incompatible change**: a naive update to this version will cause the IAM policies to shuffle, which will result in a temporary downtime of IAM permissions. If you wish to avoid this, you can set the new `var.use_managed_iam_policies` to `false`.

## Description

<!-- A description of the changes made in this release. Be sure to update any TODOs. -->

- Updated cross dependencies in examples to latest version
- Fix outdated docs on setting up cloudfront with lambda edge
- Clarify that newer than nodejs10.x and python3.7 are supported
- Upgrade to python runtime 3.9
- Fix minor typos
- Fix line break in middle of paragraph
- Fix typo: lamda -> lambda **[BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE].** 

This release fixes a typo in the aws_iam_role_policy resource, changing the name from "network_interfaces_for_lamda" to "network_interfaces_for_lambda". This is a backward incompatible change, requiring re-creation of the aws_iam_role_policy.

However, the downtime incurred by this operation should be so brief as to be negligible, because the policy will be removed and immediately added back at apply time.

If you wish to avoid this brief downtime, you can use the terraform state mv operation to move your aws_iam_role_policy resource's state via the following command:

`terraform state mv aws_iam_role_policy.network_interfaces_for_lamda aws_iam_role_policy.network_interfaces_for_lambda`

    - Once all Gruntwork repos have been upgrade to work with `1.0.x`, we will publish a migration guide with a version compatibility table and announce it all via the Gruntwork Newsletter.

## Description

<!-- A description of the changes made in this release. Be sure to update any TODOs. -->

Added new modules for configuring API Gateway:

- `api-gateway-account-settings`: This module is a straight port from [the terraform-aws-sam repo](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-sam/tree/master/modules/api-gateway-account-settings).
- `api-gateway-proxy`: This module can be used to deploy API Gateway to proxy all requests to lambda functions without having to define each method. This module supports basic path based routing for configuring multiple lambda functions under a single API Gateway.
- `api-gateway-proxy-methods`: This is a helper module to setup proxy methods to a lambda function on API Gateway.

Refer to the [module docs](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-lambda/tree/master/modules/api-gateway-proxy) and [examples](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-lambda/tree/master/examples/lambda-service) for more information on these new modules.

## Description

<!-- A description of the changes made in this release. Be sure to update any TODOs. -->

- **Terraform 0.15 upgrade**: We have verified that this repo is compatible with Terraform `0.15.x`! 
    - From this release onward, we will only be running tests with Terraform `0.15.x` against this repo, so we recommend updating to `0.15.x` soon! 
    - To give you more time to upgrade, for the time being, all modules will still support Terraform `0.12.26` and above, as that version has several features in it (`required_providers` with `source` URLs) that make it more forwards compatible with `0.15.x`. 
    - Once all Gruntwork repos have been upgrade to work with `0.15.x`, we will publish a migration guide with a version compatibility table and announce it all via the Gruntwork Newsletter.

## Description

<!-- A description of the changes made in this release. Be sure to update any TODOs. -->

- You can now use Docker images with the `lambda` module by specifying the new input variables `image_uri`, `entry_point`, `command`, and `working_directory`.
- We renamed all our repos to use HashiCorp's naming convention (`terraform-<cloud>-<name>`, e.g., `terraform-aws-vpc`), so we went through each repo and updated all the internal references. This should not affect functionality.

# v0.1.1
_Released Oct 10, 2017_
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/package-lambda/pull/7: Fix lambda module outputs.
<br>

# v0.1.0
_Released Jul 20, 2017_
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/package-lambda/pull/6: BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE. We've renamed the `source_dir` parameter to `source_path` to better reflect that the variable may point to a directory *or* a single zip file.
<br>

# v0.0.4
_Released Jul 18, 2017_
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/package-lambda/pull/4, https://github.com/gruntwork-io/package-lambda/pull/5: You can now pass your own zip file directly to the lambda module rather than having it create the zip file for you by setting the `skip_zip` param to `true`.
<br>

# v0.0.3
_Released Jun 14, 2017_
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/package-lambda/pull/3: You can now use the `lambda` module with a deployment package that is stored in S3.
<br>

# v0.0.2
_Released Jun 8, 2017_
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/package-lambda/pull/2: Remove var.zip_dir and conditional from lambda module. That means the module should work with Terraform 0.7 now.
<br>

# v0.0.1
_Released Jun 1, 2017_
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/package-lambda/pull/1: First release!
