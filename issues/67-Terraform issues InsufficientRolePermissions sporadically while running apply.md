# Terraform issues "InsufficientRolePermissions" sporadically while running apply

**anupam-rajanish-mf** commented *Apr 16, 2021*

The error:

> error waiting for Lambda Function (<FUNCTION_NAME>) creation: InsufficientRolePermissions: The function's execution role doesn't have permission to perform this operation.

This is a bug we get intermittently when running **apply** the very first time, second and subsequent **apply**'s we do not get this issue.
What has been tried:
- Adding sleep delay with **null_resource** on the attachment of additional IAM policy.
- Attaching the lambda service role: "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole" to the role od lambda function
- Refactoring the code to use **aws_iam_role_policy** with inline policy rather than _aws_iam_policy_ followed by _aws_iam_role_policy_attachment_

Terraform Version: v0.12.30. (Has been tested with v0.13)
Terrgarunt version: v0.24.4

The above issue has been discussed earlier in Gruntwork slack teams.

@ina-stoyanova Any update on this Issue?

Hey @pradeep-repaka-mf I don't believe this has been picked up yet. Is this still an active issue for you? Could you share the latest details, if you've got any more?

**pradeep-repaka-mf** commented *Jul 14, 2021*

Yes Yesterday my team member got the issue again

Hello @pradeep-repaka-mf, is this blocking you at the moment?

@yorinasub17 suggested some fixes:

- We add an `execution_role_iam_policy` input variable that adds the IAM policies within the module so we can have the function creation wait on those iam policies being attached.
- Add a `function_dependencies` input variable that causes the function creation to wait until those dependencies are materialized. Note that this should only apply to the `aws_lambda_function resource - otherwise, the chicken and egg will be introduced (the IAM role needs to be created before the iam policy can be created, but then the iam role will depend on the iam policy).
- Add a way to provide a custom execution IAM role to the module so that the user can create/manage the IAM role outside the module, and thus have full control over the creation.

We will add this to our maintenance backlog, and give you an update when we start to work on it.

Hello @anupam-rajanish-mf and @pradeep-repaka-mf ,

I read all the threads you linked and tried to reproduce the issues, but I couldn't. Nevertheless, I was able to generate a similar scenario which may indicate what the actual problem is and, luckily, there is already a readily available solution to it which will hopefully work in your case ðŸ˜„

**TL;DR:** Can you try using version `v0.12.0` of the `terraform-aws-lambda` module and test if this problem happens again?

---

Explaining the process that I did:

I created a small portion of code that tried to reproduce the issues and, no matter what I tried, I never got the errors that you had.

Trying something similar to the code that you pasted on the last link, as soon as I tried to use a `data "aws_lambda_invocation"` I got a situation in which it only worked if the lambda function was already created and failed super fast when I tried to run everything together:

```
Error: ResourceNotFoundException: Function not found: arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:738755648600:function:lambda-testing:$LATEST
{
  RespMetadata: {
    StatusCode: 404,
    RequestID: "14130aca-d708-40bc-a2f4-fbc1194a0908"
  },
  Message_: "Function not found: arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:738755648600:function:lambda-testing:$LATEST",
  Type: "User"
}

  on main.tf line 152, in data "aws_lambda_invocation" "example":
 152: data "aws_lambda_invocation" "example" {
```

Even though this error is not similar to the ones that you posted, it highlighted a similar scenario in which the function that a resource is trying to use is not available yet. So, looking at the changes from [this PR](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-lambda/pull/75) shipped at [v0.12.0](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-lambda/releases/tag/v0.12.0), more specifically at the changes on [modules/lambda/outputs.tf](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-lambda/pull/75/files#diff-5725b9cd061e9af9b8e7babba3bcef62d20e6d222121e2d26033ae7460bf2f96) we can see that the comment specifies a scenario in which the function name was being resolved and returned before the function was actually deployed, which is exactly the scenario I was having here.

After I updated the lambda module to use `v0.12.0` this issue disappeared and I was able to execute everything without problems.
Hopefully, with this change, you'll not have to try workarounds to wait for the lambda creation to associate the permissions anymore.

I get the same issue consistently when trying to deploy a new Lambda function:

```
module.lambda.aws_lambda_function.function[0]: Still creating... [30s elapsed]

â”‚ Error: error waiting for Lambda Function (cargo-text-extract) creation: InsufficientRolePermissions: The function's execution role doesn't have permission to perform this operation.

```

When I attach arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole, I am able to apply successfully.

I think there is a bug in the execution role permissions related to changes in AWS's expected permissions for Lambdas.
