# Upgrade to python runtime 3.9

**zackproser** commented *Oct 6, 2021*

These changes upgrade the now deprecated `python2.7` lambda runtime (which causes warnings on the AWS console) to python3.9. 

In testing, the image is built correctly locally and the resulting lambda can successfully fetch arbitrary URLs without error once applied.
