# update hard-coded ARN formats to use the partition returned by the awâ€¦

**hammondr** commented *Apr 7, 2022*

## Description

Currently, many ARN formats are hard-coded to use the `aws` partition name.  This works on commercial AWS but does not work for other AWS partitions, like GovCloud and other private partitions.  We can make the code more flexible and useful by determining the proper partition from the AWS provider.

### Documentation

Based on a pattern seen in terraform-aws-security/modules/aws-config-multi-region/main.tf
