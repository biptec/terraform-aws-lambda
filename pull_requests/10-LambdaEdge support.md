# Lambda@Edge support

**ghost** commented *Feb 22, 2018*

As discussed with Josh here a PR that adds a `lambda-edge` module to this package.

I didn't add any example, it would be easy for me to do so if you'd like, let me know. The part that I'm very uncomfortable in touching are the go tests as I don't know go myself and I wouldn't know how to run those.

Added a lambda-edge example (a very simple function that logs incoming requests).

@robertofpaf Is this ready for a final review?

I would say so. Sorry I've been busy with other things yesterday...

@robertofpaf I can't push changes back to your fork, so my ability to modify this PR is limited. Therefore, I've taken all the changes here, added the automated tests, and opened a new PR in #11. Let's continue the discussion over there.
