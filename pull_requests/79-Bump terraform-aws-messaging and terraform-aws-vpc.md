# Bump terraform-aws-messaging and terraform-aws-vpc

**yorinasub17** commented *Aug 10, 2021*

This PR bumps `terraform-aws-messaging` and `terraform-aws-vpc` in the examples to the latest version to remove references to the `template` provider. With this change, this repo no longer uses the `template` provider.
